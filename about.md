# About Meg

Meg (Margaret) Anderson Kilfoil is a data scientist, small business owner, knitter. She is the owner of [CustomFit Knits](customfitknits.com), a custom sweater knitting pattern generator.

No one is entirely sure when Meg learned to knit. At some point in her childhood, her mother put needles into her hands in an attempt to get her to sit still for ten minutes and here we are decades later. A [data scientist in her day job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaretandersonkilfoil/details/experience/), CustomFit Knits combines her passions of knitting and getting computers do the math for us.

Meg lives her life on the East Coast of Canada with her spouse and their dogs.
